          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2018, Glow & Bloom began as a small passion project
            between two cosmetic chemists who believed beauty products could be
            both effective and ethically made. What started as handmade batches
            in a home kitchen has blossomed into a trusted brand available in
            over 500 stores nationwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've stayed true to our roots - every product is still developed
            with the same care and attention to detail as those first small
            batches. Our team has grown to include dermatologists, botanists,
            and sustainability experts who help us create formulas that deliver
            visible results while respecting your skin and our planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Glow & Bloom, we're not just selling beauty products - we're
            cultivating confidence and self-care rituals that make you feel as
            beautiful on the inside as you look on the outside.
